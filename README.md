# ISO 27001/2 Assessment

## Overview
Welcome to the **ISO 27001/2 Assessment** repository. This repository contains reports, test results, and documentation related to the evaluation of the **ISO 27001/2** security framework. The purpose of this assessment is to analyse the effectiveness of ISO 27001/2 security controls in mitigating modern cyber threats using real-world attack simulations and penetration testing methodologies.

## Objectives
- Evaluate the effectiveness of ISO 27001/2 security controls.
- Identify gaps and areas for improvement within the framework.
- Document security test results, methodologies, and recommendations.
- Contribute research insights for improving ISO 27001/2 compliance.

## Methodology
The assessment follows a structured penetration testing and security evaluation process, based on:
- **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)**
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**
- **Real-world exploitation techniques and security best practices**

### Key Testing Steps:
1. **Reconnaissance** - Gathering intelligence on the test environment.
2. **Threat Modelling** - Identifying potential attack vectors.
3. **Vulnerability Analysis** - Reviewing security configurations and policies.
4. **Exploitation** - Simulating real-world attacks against ISO 27001/2-compliant systems.
5. **Post-Exploitation** - Assessing the impact of successful attacks.
6. **Reporting** - Documenting findings and providing mitigation strategies.

## Key Findings
- **Risk Management Effectiveness:** Evaluated the framework's ability to mitigate risks through policy and control implementations.
- **Access Control Measures:** Tested user authentication, authorisation, and privilege escalation resistance.
- **Cryptographic Controls:** Assessed encryption standards, data protection mechanisms, and key management policies.
- **Incident Response & Monitoring:** Reviewed log management, event correlation, and response workflows.
- **Supply Chain Security:** Analysed third-party security compliance and vendor risk management practices.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Understanding of **ISO 27001/2** principles and controls.
- Knowledge of **penetration testing** methodologies.
- Access to a test environment (e.g., virtual machines, cloud-based cyber range).
